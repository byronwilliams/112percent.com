Curation is key in the world. We go to art galleries to look at the best pieces of art, museums for the best
archelogical finds. `npm` allows anyone to upload their packages, of any quality. Sure, we get art and artifacts of
varying quality, but when we have choice we want the best.

I write quite a bit of [Go](http://golang.com) and comparatively it has a well curated set of libraries. I don't have
to think which zipping library to use, it's just `encoding/zip`. If I want a hash function then I can look in the
`x/crypto` paths.

The reason for Go's library quality is probably it's barrier to entry. Go is harder to write than JavaScript and the
people writing it are probably more stringent with how they code.

Python's package repository also exhibits a similar, but not as strong commitment to quality. In the Python world you
generally know that if you are going to do something with HTTP requests then you use Kenneth Reinnitz's Requests library.
There are very few cases where the obvious choice is not.... obvious.

When recently looking for a `npm` package to zip up a folder I struggled to find "the one". I started with looking at
the `gulp-zip` package. It uses `yazl` which is great, but it doesn't support Promises, Admittedly it's not too much
work to work around.
