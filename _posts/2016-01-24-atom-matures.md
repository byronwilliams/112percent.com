This time last year I would not have touched [Atom](http://atom.io) with a barge pole. It was slow, buggy and very slow.

What a difference a year makes. I've now switched from Sublime Text (ST) to Atom permanently as it's fast enough.
It's still definitely slower that ST, but fast enough for may day to day usage. The startup speed is still not great,
but I only open my editor once a day.

One of my original gripes was that I couldn't have multiple folders in a project - I can now!

There are plenty of packages, again it suffers the `npm` problem, but the easy visiblilty of the number of downloads
easily sorts that out. `atom-typescript` is fantastic for all of my Angular work.

My key bindings are nicely setup and are easy to customise. Like with everything I imagine that I only use 10% of the
available features.
