Hi All,

I've started a new blog, got a new domain and everything. I've setup my hosting over to
[Figroll](http://www.figroll.io), a static site hosting company. I'm super impressed with their offering. I'm using
Hugo to generate the site. And the figroll-cli node package to upload it. I did play around with the drag and drop,
whilst cool, I like an automated workflow.

I'm currently learning Angular2 at the moment after playing around with Angular1 for many years. I've already found
a few really cool things out. I'll post about them over the coming weeks.
