It is, it always has been. We find excuses not to do things all of the time, sometimes it's procrastination, other times
it's pure lazyness, or maybe a lack of confidence.

If you are not working towards your goals. All I want to do is work on:

    1. Getting Figroll/Pebbl within 6 months to be a success such that it fuel future projects
    2. Start Insect Farming and produce bars within a year.
    4. Build a cabin somewhere.
