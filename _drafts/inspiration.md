I've always known that development is a creative process. Your creative juices can flow or run dry. When I started this
blog 4 months ago I was really engrossed with Angular2 and some Golang! I was excited, learning new things and making
good progress towards my project. Currently I feel like a lake in drought.

I feel that after working really hard for the last 5 months I'm struggling with my energy levels. Perhaps working on a
few personal projects as well as work was too much. I guess it's time to take a break.
