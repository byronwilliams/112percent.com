I've only ever come across 3 reasons for leaving your job:

1. You're unhappy with your pay
2. You're unhappy with the working environment
3. Some external influence (think: spouse has a new job, ill family member)

People often complain about their pay... but it's normally a non-issue. They'd have a job which paid them more if they
asked for a pay rise or got a job somewhere else doing something else. People often don't leave their job for this
reason (at least in my experience).

External influences happen rarely for most people and these cases the decision is already made by something else so you
just have to get on with it.

Being unhappy with your working environment is not necessarily a choice. Sometimes hiring a new member of staff starts
to alter your company culture. People leaving help to erode the values and new staff are hired which don't necessarily
embody enough of the culture to keep it alive.

Culture though really does come from the top. If your leadership team are keen on getting things done fast naturally
you compromise on quality. If you wish to make speedy and hasty decisions you may have considered the business
implication but not the cultural one.

For example...

> imagine you've been having issues with your hosting provider for a few months and they're not really up
to the level you like, the bosses have mentioned that they're talking to other parties... But then crunch time happens -
you're about to get loads more users onboarded, your current infrastructure can't cope, you need to change provider. So
they do. They talk with the new providers who promise the world, you make what you think are the necessary changes
deploy your application and it all seems fine. But what did you forget?

You forgot that

* the deployment process needed changing
* the new hosting provider doesn't bill you the way you expected
* you overlooked part of their auto scaling feature

Now in order to get everything up to scratch you ask your employees to work later and longer hours for a few days to a
few weeks. But then you find out that

* you've not been sending out all emails out because your SPF record wasn't changed and therefore have not notify
your customers
* some code got hastily changed and now you've ended up with some customers receiving discounts on their orders when
then were not supposed to be.
* one of your colleagues is leaving because of this.


Blah blah says that once you've considered leaving you've current job you've already convinced yourself that you're
not happy and that it's the best thing to do. I believe that once you've convinced of this that you turn into a pessamist
and that everything at work starts to become much more of a chore.

I've noticed this with a few colleagues recently. We've gone through lots of changes at work with many people's job roles
becoming rather blurred, including my own. From my perspective I've hardly written any code over the last 3 months. I'm
not doing the job I enjoy, instead I'm doing a job tangentially linked, but it's not the job I was employed with.

I've passively already left my job, I'm not doing it anymore and I don't know when I'll go back, or that even if I could
I would.

Why are my colleagues leaving? Is it due to something I've done, something we've been complicit in, or is it down to
culture? It's super interesting to watch a whole group of people in a department just leave... all at the same time.
The same comment resounds from them - "I don't care any more".

How can this happen? How can people stop caring? I know they enjoyed their work before but because they've been put
under too much pressure, receiving not enough help and have been blamed for the events they've given up. They can't see
through the darkness.

And why should they? Working for a startup sure means slightly more challenging situations more often, often with
much more at stake than in a longer running business. They knew that going in. The problem is that if your staff are
having these problems you have started to erode your team and your culture.

If stop caring they often tell their colleagues they are unhappy which has such a detrimental effect to morale and
makes the group subsequently unhappy making more of them stop caring.

Normally I'm the one who leaves first in these situations. I'd rather search for employment elsewhere than be complicit
in a morale zapping, poor cultured workplace. This time around I'm on the back foot, I haven't left yet. As my closest
work friends are leaving there seems to be little left for me. My job is not my job, the friends that I've made won't be
there, new ones will come along sure, but it won't change the fact that I don't want to go through the process again.

But what we do know is that things don't change. Changing culture is hard, so hard that I've not personally seen it
done, as a company you need to be so hot on your culture. It's cliched to say, but true.
